Configuring the GitHub credentials
==================================

To successfully push the site to GitHub, the plugin needs your GitHub credentials, or at least credentials that can
push to the repository.

There are several ways to configure the access:

* from the Maven `settings.xml` file using a pair username - password
* from the plugin configuration (not recommended)

Using username/password or oauth
---------------------------------

The easiest way to give access to your repository is to add a `server` in your _settings.xml_ with your username and
password (or from any account that can push to the repository).

In your `~/.m2/settings.xml` file, add a `server` entry as follows:

    <server>
	   <id>github</id>
    	<username>YOUR_USERNAME</username>
    	<password>YOUR_PASSWORD</password>
  	</server>

Using oauth is quite similar. Once you have done all the preliminaries (see [GitHub OAuth support](http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/)), add a `server` entry as follows:

    <server>
        <id>github</id>
        <password>OAUTH2TOKEN</password>
    </server>

The server's id (_github_) is used in the plugin configuration:

    <plugin>
        <!-- Deploy the web site -->
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
            <execution>
                <goals>
                    <goal>site</goal>
                </goals>
                <phase>site-deploy</phase>
                <configuration>
                    <!-- must match the server's id  -->
                    <server>github</server>

                    <!-- The commit message -->
                    <message>Building site for my project</message>
                    <!-- The location where the site is uploaded -->
                    <path>${site.path}</path>
                    <!-- Use merge or override the content -->
                    <merge>true</merge>
                </configuration>
            </execution>
        </executions>
    </plugin>

There is another way to configure the server id, avoiding you to write in in the plugin configuration. Set the
`github.global.server` property:

    <properties>
      <github.global.server>github</github.global.server>
    </properties>

This snippet can be either in your pom file or in a profile from your `settings.xml`.

Setting the username and password inside the plugin configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This way is **not recommended**. You can configure the authentication from the plugin configuration with the
following parameters:

* `userName` (requires the password)
* `password` (requires the username)
* `oauth2Token` (is sufficient)
